# WNBA Standings

Tracking the WNBA standings over the course of the season.

Each plot shows how many games above or below .500 every team was throughout the course of the season. As of 2022, the top 8 teams make the playoffs, hence the gap in the legend, but be warned that I didn't actually code up the tie-breaker scenarios, so ties are broken arbitrarily on this page.

This project was inspired by Greg Stoll's [MLB Division Race Charts](https://gregstoll.com/baseballdivisionraces/).

All statistics are from the amazing [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/).

WNBA team colors were identified by [Team Color Codes](https://teamcolorcodes.com/wnba-color-codes/).

Special thanks to Lisa DeBruine for the [great demo](https://debruine.github.io/quarto_demo/dark_mode.html) on using light/dark modes in Quarto.
