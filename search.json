Ties are broken arbitrarily, as I didn’t actually code up the tie-breaker scenarios.\nElo ratings are a way of estimating a team’s “true” skill level, invented by Arpad Elo to rank chess players (Wikipedia). The rating system used here was adapted from the WNBA ratings system implemented by fivethirtyeight.com. Ratings are partially carried over from year to year, which is why the lines have different starting values. The long-run average rating is 1500."
