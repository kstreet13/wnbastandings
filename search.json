Ties are broken arbitrarily, as I didn’t actually code up the tie-breaker scenarios.\nElo ratings are a way of estimating a team’s “true” skill level, invented by Arpad Elo to rank chess players (Wikipedia). The rating system used here was adapted from the WNBA ratings system implemented by fivethirtyeight.com. Ratings are partially carried over from year to year, which is why the lines have different starting values. The long-run average rating is 1500."

    "text": "Elo Model Performance\nFor each game, the model estimates the probabilities of each team winning, based on their relative ratings. These probabilities add up to 100% and we say that the model “picks” whichever team has better than a 50% chance of winning.\nPercent correct: 66.16%\nRecord: 174-89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if the Elo model was perfect, it would still get some games wrong due to inherent randomness. The model might correctly identify that a team has a 60% chance of winning, but its “pick” will be wrong 40% of the time. For the blue distribution above, we assume that the probabilities estimated by the model are exactly right and simulate every game according to those probabilities."
